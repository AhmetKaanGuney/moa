[Show first slide]
    - Page has:
        - MOA text
        - Name : Ahmet Kaan GÃ¼ney
        - City, Country: Istanbul, Turkey

[VO]
    - Hi everyone. I'm Ahmet. Let me explain what is MOA?

[Show What is MOA? page]

[VO]
    - MOA is a simple tool for editing your matricies.
      It's designed for people who want to group their
      rows and columns easily.

[Show How it Works? page]

[VO]
    - So how MOA works exactly:

    - Let's say that you have a matrix that you want to edit.
    [1st stage]
    1. You upload the file to the server.

    [2nd stage]
    2. Then the server reads your file and returns you a
       blueprint.

    [3rd stage]
    3. You edit your blueprint.

    [4th stage]
    4. After you're done, you send back the blueprint.

    [5th stage]
    5. The server will create a new Excel file according
       to blueprint that you have sent.

[Show How to Use? page]
[VO]
    - Let's go through an example so that we understand it better.

    [Show example matrix]
    - Here we see a matrix about food purchases. Each cell
      represents how much an individual has bought a
      certain type of food.
    - Let's assume that we want to group the individuals as
      men and wowen.

    - So let's go to the moa.pythonanywhere.com
    [Go to moa.pythonanywhere.com]

    - Select our file
    [Select example.xlsx]

    - Let me show you how to enter the matrix coordinates.
    [Show example matrix with pointers]

    - By the way if there are empty rows or columns inside the matrix coordinates
      program will give you an error.
      So don't upload a matrix like in these examples.
    [Show examples with pointers to what's wrong]

    - Let's enter the coodinates.
    [Enter coordinates]

    - Alright let's hit submit.
    [Upload file to server]

    [Show blueprint page]
    - Now we want to group individuals as men and women.
    - I'll create a group called men.
    [Open Group Create Modal]
        [Explain Modal]
            - So we write the name of the group here.
            [Show input field]
            - And here we see the options for the group's
            type. Selecting 'both' will create a row and
            a column with the same name.
        - Hit enter
        [Hit enter]

    - Now I'll add Ross and Joey to the Men's group.
    - You can just click on the element you want to add.
      If you want to remove the same is true.

    - Now I'll create a group called Women.
    [Create Women group]
    [Add Monica and Rachel]
    - So at this point if we hit Export and select a format,
      I'm gonna select .xlsx.
    [Hit export (.xlsx)]
    - Let's open the file.
    [Open file]
    - Here you can see that we successfully grouped individuls as
      Men and Women. And you can see that cells of Ross and Joey
      are summed together. And same is true with Monica and Rachel.
      Because we grouped them together.

[End slide]
    - Alright that's it. Thanks for watching.
