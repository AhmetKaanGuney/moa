WHAT'S THIS PROGRAM IS FOR?

TasnifEx is a tool for editing your matrices.
You can :
- Group/Ungroup your rows and columns
- Name your groups
- The program will handle the adding of values (and future functions)
- Export the edited matrix into a new file

Supported read/write formats:
CSV:
    - *.csv (Comma separated values)
    - CSV (Macintosh)
    - CSV (MS-DOS)

(Optional):
- *.xls
- *.xlsx

Difference between CSV- MS and Mac:

The difference between [them] is if you have certain
special characters in text fields; for example,
an accented (foreign language) character.
If you export as Windows CSV, those fields are encoded
using the Windows-1252 code page. DOS encoding usually
uses code page 437, which maps characters used in old
pre-Windows PCs. If you export as one and then import
with a tool that expects the other, most things will
look fine but you'll get unexpected results if, for example,
you know someone with an umlaut (or other foreign character)
in their name.
