WHAT IS MOA?

MOA (Matrix Operations Application) is a simple tool for editing your matrix.

HOW IT WORKS?

- Enter the coordinates of your matrix in your document:
    - First Row: the number of the first row
    - Last Row: the number of the last row
    - First Col: the letter of the first column
    - Last Col: the letter of the last column
    Note: If you have empty rows or columns inside
        your matrix (not the document) you will get an error.

- Upload your file. (Supported formats: '.xls', '.xlsx', '.csv')

- You will be redirected to a new page with two lists side by side:
    - On the left side you have row and column names that was in your matrix.
    - On the right side you have row and column names that's in the group you
        have selected. Which you haven't yet. That's why it's empty.

- Create row or column groups.
    - A window will pop-up when you click 'Create Group' from the Group menu.
    - You can select which type of group you want to create:
        - Row, Column or Both.
        - Selecting 'Both' will create a row and a column group, with the same name.

- Add rows to the row groups and add columns to the column groups.
    - Just click on the name you want to add.
    - If you want to remove a name from a group just click on it.

- After you are done go to the Download menu and select a format.
    - You should see the download prompt from your browser.
    - Hit Save.

- That's it! Enjoy your new matrix.
