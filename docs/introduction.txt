WHAT IS MOA?

MOA (Matrix Operations Application) is a simple tool for editing your matrices.

HOW IT WORKS?

- Enter the coordinates of your matrix in your document:
    - First Row: the number of the first row
    - Last Row: the number of the last row
    - First Col: the letter of the first column
    - Last Col: the letter of the last column
    Note: If you have empty rows or columns inside
        your matrix (not the document) you will get an error.

- Upload your file. (Supported formats: '.xls', '.xlsx', '.csv')

- You will be redirected to a new page with two lists side by side:
    - On the left side you have row and column names that was in your matrix.
    - On the right side you have row and column names that's in the group you
        have selected. Which you haven't yet. That's why it's empty.

- Create row or column groups.
    - A window will pop-up when you click 'Create Group' from the Group menu.
    - You can select which type of group you want to create:
        - Row, Column and Both.
        - Selecting both will create a row and a column group with the same name.

- Add rows to the row groups and add columns to the column groups.
    - Just click on the name you want to add.
    - If you want to remove a name from the group just click on it.

- Go to the Download menu and select a format.
    - You should see the download prompt from your browser.
    - Hit Save.

- That's it! Enjoy your new matrix.



Difference between CSV- MS and Mac:

The difference between [them] is if you have certain
special characters in text fields; for example,
an accented (foreign language) character.
If you export as Windows CSV, those fields are encoded
using the Windows-1252 code page. DOS encoding usually
uses code page 437, which maps characters used in old
pre-Windows PCs. If you export as one and then import
with a tool that expects the other, most things will
look fine but you'll get unexpected results if, for example,
you know someone with an umlaut (or other foreign character)
in their name.
